The vets.gov migration status dashboard summarizes the work currently underway to migrate content, forms, and services to vets.gov. Each product has a status as it moves through our standard <a href="https://www.vets.gov/playbook/product-methodology/">vets.gov product methodology</a>. Status is updated weekly by vets.gov product leads using the following legend:
<br>
<ul class="legend">
    <li><span class="status complete"></span> Complete</li>
    <li><span class="status in-progress"></span> In Progress </li>
    <li><span class="status low-risk"></span> Risk of Delay*</li>
    <li><span class="status high-risk"></span> Delayed** </li>
    <li><span class="status not-started"></span> Not Started</li>
</ul>

<p class="note">* Risks being managed by team, but may require escalation<br>
** requires action / assistance</p>
<br>

This scope of this tool is limited to new and existing content, forms, and services that are being developed and launched on vets.gov in 2016.  If you have any questions, please contact vavetsgov-team@va.gov.
