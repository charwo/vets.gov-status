The vets.gov migration status dashboard summarizes the work currently underway to migrate content, forms, and services to vets.gov. Each product has a status as it moves through our standard <a href="https://www.vets.gov/playbook/product-methodology/">vets.gov product methodology</a>. Status is updated weekly by vets.gov product leads using the following legend:
<br><br>
<ul class="legend">
    <li><span class="status complete"></span> Completed</li>
    <li><span class="status in-progress"></span> In Progress </li>
    <li><span class="status low-risk"></span> Low/Moderate risk*</li>
    <li><span class="status high-risk"></span> High risk** </li>
    <li><span class="status not-started"></span> Not Started</li>
</ul>

<p class="note">* May require escalation ** Requires escalation/action</p>
